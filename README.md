# Interactive-web-application-with-Python-Flask
The purpose of this project was to create a web application tailored for a Company's University Program. In the speciﬁc, the portal developed aimed at eﬀectively improving the company's knowledge about potential partnering universities. This was be done by following two goals. First of all, to gather and group data about prospective and already existing academic partners. Second of all, to provide a clear visualization of the analyses made to facilitate and improve the engagement with them. 
To ensure an holistic relationship with the partnering academic institutions, the company needed to completely understand the universities they were engaged with. Knowing the customers is a key step to provide tailored and improved services, which can in turn result into stronger relationships and enthusiastic recommendations. The information gathered by using the portal, were then essential to make an eﬃcient market research that was used to answer some crucial questions: 

What were the universities’ interests? 
What was their focus and goal? 
How were the universities perceived on the web and on Twitter? Was the company currently engaging them in a meaningful way? 


The web portal was developed following ﬁve main guidelines or tasks that can be summarized in: 

1. Allow easy access to the relevant statistics about all the universities. 
2. Display the main teaching and research areas of interest of the Russel Group’s1 members. 
3. Provide a Twitter analysis of the tweets related to the Russel Group members and the company. 
4. Analyse the most recent news and blog posts available on the web about the company and the Russel 
Group members. 
5. Provide a clear visualization of the results and ensure that the databases are updateable. 

Let's visualize some of the pages displayed in the web application:

### Part of the Home page

### End user page to filter through an SQL parsed database about the universities' statistics:

### End user page to review the results of the filtered database

# NOTES
COMPANY.py is the main file for the web application and the twitter.py file is the secondary file for the twitter analysis.
The application is Flask based, and it uses SQL to parse through the defined databases and display the data about the universities.

As a final note, I want to point out that since the project was for a specific company, the codes and files have been anonymized. Nevertheless, I still had to delete some part of the code that was too specific for the company of the interest. For this reason, there may be some functions or lines that do not have a reference within the code, but that should not cause any issue in understanding what is going on within the application.

Thank your for you attention.

Hope you enjoyed it :)
